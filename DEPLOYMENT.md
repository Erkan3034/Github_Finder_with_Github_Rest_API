## ðŸš€ Railway Deployment Steps

### 1. Prepare Repository
```bash
# Ensure all files are committed
git add .
git commit -m "Prepare for Railway deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Deploy to Railway
1. Go to [Railway Dashboard](https://railway.app/dashboard)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
4. Choose your repository: `Erkan3034/Github_Finder_with_Github_Rest_API`
5. Railway will automatically detect the Python app

### 3. Environment Variables (Optional)
Railway automatically sets:
- `PORT` - Application port (automatically set)

Optional environment variables:
- `SECRET_KEY` - Flask secret key (optional, has default)

### 4. Monitor Deployment
1. Check the deployment logs in Railway dashboard
2. Ensure all dependencies are installed successfully
3. Verify the application starts without errors

### 5. Access Your App
- Railway will provide a URL like: `https://your-app-name.railway.app`
- The app should be accessible immediately after deployment

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Fails**
   - Check `requirements.txt` for correct dependencies
   - Ensure `runtime.txt` specifies a supported Python version
   - Verify `Procfile` syntax is correct

2. **App Won't Start**
   - Check Railway logs for error messages
   - Ensure `app.py` has correct `if __name__ == '__main__':` block
   - Verify port configuration uses `os.environ.get('PORT', 5000)`

3. **Dependencies Missing**
   - Add missing packages to `requirements.txt`
   - Redeploy after updating requirements

4. **Environment Variables**
   - Check if `SECRET_KEY` is set (optional)
   - Verify `PORT` is automatically set by Railway

### Useful Commands
```bash
# Check local requirements
pip freeze > requirements.txt

# Test locally with gunicorn
gunicorn app:app

# Check Python version
python --version
```
